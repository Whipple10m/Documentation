# Manuals for various 10m system components.

This space hosts manuals for various components of the 10m system, or links to them on external sites.

## Clock system

- [grsmanual2a.pdf](https://github.com/Whipple10m/Documentation/blob/main/components/gpsmanual2a.pdf): manual for the GRS2 clock interface / scalar CAMAC module, created by the University of Wisconsin. This manual is seemingly unavailable on the web in 2024, so I have uploaded a version I have in hopes it could be useful.
- Before the GRS2 clock interface was installed a system developped by the University of Michigan was used to read the GPS clock, as described by [Freeman and Akerlof, NIM A320, 1992 305-309](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/29901/0000258.pdf)
- [Truetime XL-DC clock (hosted by LBL, downloaded 2024-12-30)](https://glacier.lbl.gov/gtp/DOM/Support/xl-dc-manual.pdf)
- [Truetime XL-AK clock (hosted by LBL, downloaded 2024-12-30)](https://glacier.lbl.gov/gtp/DOM/Support/xl-ak-manual.pdf)
