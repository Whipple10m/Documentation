# Manuals for various 10m system components.

This space hosts manuals for various components of the 10m system. These documents are copyright their various authors.

- [grsmanual2a.pdf](https://github.com/Whipple10m/Documentation/blob/main/components/gpsmanual2a.pdf): manual for the GRS2 clock interface / scalar CAMAC module, created by the University of Wisconsin. This manual is seemingly unavailable on the web in 2024.

Manuals for some of the system components can be found elsewhere (not an exhausive list):
